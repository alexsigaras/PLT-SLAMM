 <ul><li>the representation of programs</li>
  <li>the syntax and constraints of the language</li>
  <li>the semantic rules for interpreting programs</li>
  <li>the representation of input data to be processed by programs</li>
  <li>the representation of output data produced by programs</li>
  <li>other restrictions on programs (such as what makes a program portable
      across different implementations and platforms)</li>
 </ul><h2>3. The C Programming Language</h2>
 <ul><li>C is a general-purpose procedural programming language that was designed in 1969-1972
      at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie who was working on developing the Unix
      operating system with Ken Thompson. It is still one of the most widely
      used programming languages in the world.</li> 
  <li>C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system
      on the DEC PDP-11.</li>
  <li>In 1978 Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the book
      "The C Programming Language" which for many years
      served as the informal definition of C ("K&amp;R C").</li>
  <li>Kernighan and Ritchie described C as "a general-purpose programming language
      which features economy of expression, modern control flow and data structures,
      and a rich set of operators."</li>
  <li>C has gone through a number of versions since K&amp;R C:</li>
   <ul><li>ANSI C (1989) and ISO C (1990): these versions are identical and are
        commonly referred to as C89</li>
    <li>C99: ISO/IEC9899:1999</li>
    <li>C11, the current standard, adopted in 12/8/2011</li>
    <li>Embedded C: in 2008 the C Standards Committee extended C to create
        programs to meet the stringent requirements of microcontroller systems</li>
   </ul><br/><li>A sample C program
 <ul/><pre><code>
 (1)  /* this program computes the greatest common divisor
 (2)     of two integers entered on the command line */

 (3)  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 (4)  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

 (5)  int gcd(int m, int n)
 (6)  {
 (7)    int r;
 (8)    while ((r = m % n) != 0) {
 (9)      m = n;
(10)      n = r;
(11)    }
(12)    return n;
(13)  }

(14)  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
(15)  {
(16)    int m, n;
(17)    m = atoi(argv[1]);
(18)    n = atoi(argv[2]);
(19)    printf("gcd of %d and %d is %d\n", m, n, gcd(m, n)); 
(20)    return 0;
(21)  }
 </code></pre>
 </li></ul><h2>4. Fundamental Elements of Programming Languages</h2>
 <ul><li>Programming model</li>
  <ul><li>The programming model is the model of computation encapsulated
       into the programming language.</li>
   <ul><font color="#0000ff">
    <li>For example, C is an imperative language, designed around the
      von Neumann model of computation.</li>
   </font></ul></ul><li>Program structure</li>
  <ul><li>A program typically consists of one or more translation units stored in files.</li>
   <ul><font color="#0000ff">
    <li>In C, a translation unit is a sequence of function definitions and declarations.</li>
   </font></ul></ul><li>Character set and lexical conventions</li>
  <ul><li>Source and target character sets may be different.</li>
   <ul><font color="#0000ff">
    <li>The character set of C source programs in contained within seven-bit ASCII.</li>
   </font></ul><li>A token is a meaningful sequence of characters in a source program.</li>
   <ul><font color="#0000ff">
    <li>C has six classes of tokens: identifiers, keywords, constants, string literals,
        operators, and separators.</li>
   </font></ul></ul><li>Names, scopes, bindings, and lifetimes</li>
  <ul><li>Names (often called identifiers) have a specified lexical structure.</li>
   <ul><font color="#0000ff">
    <li>In C identifiers are sequences of letters (here, underscore is considered a letter) and digits.
        The first character of an identifier must be a letter. At least the first 31 characters in an
        identifier are significant.</li>
   </font></ul><li>The scope of a name is the region of the program in
       which it is known (visible).</li>
   <li>A binding is an association between two things such as between a
       variable and its type or between a symbol and the operation it represents.
       The time at which this association is determined is called
       the binding time. Bindings can take place at various times ranging
       from language design time to run time.</li>
   <li>The lifetime of a variable is the time during which the variable
       is bound to a specific memory location.</li>
  </ul><li>Memory management</li>
  <ul><li>One important function of a programming language is to provide facilities
       for managing memory and the objects stored in memory.</li>
   <ul><font color="#0000ff">
    <li>C provides three ways to allocate memory for objects:</li>
    <ul><li>Static allocation where space for an object is provided by the compiler at run time.</li>
     <li>Automatic allocation where temporary objects are stored by the compiler on the runtime stack.
         This space is automatically freed by the compiler after the block in which the object is
         declared is exited.</li>
     <li>Dynamic allocation where blocks of memory of arbitrary size can be requested
         by a programmer using runtime library functions such as malloc from a region of
         memory called the heap.  These blocks
         persist until freed by a call to a runtime library function such as free.</li>
    </ul></font></ul></ul><li>Data types and operators</li>
  <ul><li>A data type defines a set of data values and the operations allowed
       on those values.</li>
   <ul><font color="#0000ff">
    <li>C has a small number of basic types, including <code>char, int, double, float,
          enum, void</code>.</li>
    <li>C has a potentially infinite number of recursively
          defined derived types
          such as arrays of objects of some type, functions returning objects of
          some type, pointers to objects of some type, structures containing a sequence
          of objects of various types, and unions containing any one of several
          objects of various types.</li>
    <li>C has a rich set of arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators.</li>
   </font></ul></ul><li>Expressions and assignment statements</li>
  <ul><li>Expressions are the primary means for specifying computations
       in a programming language.</li>
   <li>Assignment statements are basic constructs in imperative programming languages.
       Assignment statements allow the programmer to dynamically change
       the bindings of values to variables.</li>
  </ul><li>Control flow</li>
  <ul><li>Flow of control refers to the sequence in which the operations specified in
       a program are executed at run time. There are flow-of-control issues at
       many levels such as flow of control within
       expressions, among statements, and among program units.
       Most programming languages have control statements and other control
       structures for controlling the flow of control within a program.</li>
   <ul><font color="#0000ff">
    <li>C has a variety of flow-of-control constructs such as blocks and
        control statements such as <code>if-else, switch, while, for,
        do-while, break, continue</code> and <code>goto</code>.</li>
   </font></ul></ul><li>Functions and process abstraction</li>
  <ul><li>Functions are perhaps the most important building blocks of programs.
       Functions are often called procedures, subroutines, or subprograms.
       Functions break large computing tasks into smaller ones and facilitate
       code reuse.  Functions are such an important topic in programming
       languages that we will talk about them in much more detail later in
       this course.</li>
  </ul><li>Data abstraction and object orientation</li>
  <ul><li>Data abstraction in the form of abstract data types was introduced
       into programming languages after process abstraction. The programming
       language Simula67 was instrumental
       in motivating constructs for supporting object-oriented programming
       in modern programming languages such as C++, C#, and Java.
       Object orientation is characterized by encapsulation, polymorphism,
       inheritance, and dynamic binding.</li>
  </ul><li>Concurrency</li>
  <ul><li>Concurrent execution of programs has assumed much more importance with
       the widespread use of multi-core and many-core processors.</li>
   <li>Concurrency
       in software execution can occur many levels of granularity: instruction,
       statement, subprogram, and program.</li>
   <li>Concurrency can be achieved with libraries (like MPI for Fortran, pthreads
       for C) or with direct language support (as in Cilk, X10).</li>
   <li>However, effective exploitation of concurrency is still an open
       research area in software.</li>
  </ul><li>Exception and event handling</li>
  <ul><li>Many languages have facilities for reacting to run-time error conditions.
       C++ has the <code>try-catch</code> construct to catch exceptions raised by the
       <code>throw</code> statement.</li>
   <li>Event handling is like exception handling in that an event handler is called
       by the occurence of an event. Implementing reactions to user interactions
       with GUI components is a common application of event handling.</li>
