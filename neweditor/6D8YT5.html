 <hr/><h2>Instructions</h2>
 <ul><li>You may discuss the questions with others but your answers
      must be your own words and your own code.</li>
  <li>Problems 1-4 are each worth 25 points.</li>
  <li>Solutions to these problems will be posted
      on Courseworks on February 20, 2013.</li>
  <li>This assignment may submitted electronically on Courseworks by 2:40pm,
      February 20, 2013 for 50% credit.</li>
 </ul><h2>Problems</h2>
 <ol><li>Construct Lex-style regular expressions for the following patterns.
      For each pattern, create a Lex program to find the first longest lowercase word
      in the dictionary satisfying that pattern. As part of your
      answer list your program and the longest word found.  State what dictionary
      you used (e.g., on Linux systems <code>/usr/dict/words</code>).
      You can use any variant of Lex such as Flex, JLex, Ocamllex, PLY, etc.</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>All lowercase English words that can be made up using only the letters
       in your first name. Each letter in your name can be used zero or more times
       and in any order in a word.</li>
   <li>All lowercase English words that can be made up using exactly the letters
       in your first name. Each letter in your name must be used exactly the
       number of times it appears in your name but the letters can appear
       in any order in a word. If your name
       has more than five letters, use the prefix of length five.</li>
  </ol><br/><li>Let <i>L</i> be the language consisting of all
      strings of <i>a</i>'s, <i>b</i>'s, and
      <i>c</i>'s such that each string is of the form
      <i>abxba</i> where <i>x</i> does not contain <i>ba</i> as a substring.
      These strings model comments in the programming language C.
  </li>

  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Write down a deterministic finite automaton
       (DFA) for <i>L</i>.</li>
   <li>Minimize the number states in your DFA. Briefly explain how you did the minimization.</li>
   <li>Explain what property of the scanned input each state of your minimized DFA recognizes.</li>
   <li>Write down a regular expression for <i>L</i>.
  </li></ol><br/><li>Let <i>L</i> be the language consisting of just balanced parentheses,
      i.e., {<code>ε, ( ), ( ( ) ), ( ) ( ), ( ( ( ) ) ), ( ( ) ( ) ), ...</code> }
  </li>

  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Write down a recursive definition for <i>L</i>.</li>
   <li>Use the pumping lemma for regular languages to show that <i>L</i>
       cannot be specified by a regular expression.</li>
  </ol><br/><li>Let <i>R</i> be a regular expression of length <i>m</i> and let <i>w</i> be an input string
      of length <i>n</i>. Briefly discuss in terms
      of <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> the time-space complexity of the McNaughton-Yamada-Thompson
      algorithm  to
      determine whether <i>w</i> is in <i>L</i>(<i>R</i>).</li>
