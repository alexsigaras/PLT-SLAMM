 </ol><h2>1. Issues in Code Generation</h2>
 <ul><li>Role of the code generator</li>
  <ul><li>Input: IR of the source program produced by the font end</li>
   <li>Output: good target machine code</li>
  </ul><li>Challenges of code generation</li>
  <ul><li>The target program must preserve the semantic meaning of the
       source program.</li>
   <li>The target program should make efficient use of the target
       machine's resources.</li>
   <li>The code generator itself should be efficient.</li>
   <li>The problem of optimal code generation is undecidable.</li>
   <li>Many subproblems in code generation, such as optimal register
       allocation, are computationally intractable.</li>
   <li>The design of a good code generator often reverts to the problem of
       designing good heuristics.</li>
  </ul></ul><h2>2. Memory Hierarchy</h2>
 <ul><li>Processor registers are the fastest devices in a computer's
      memory hierarchy.  Here are some typical access times and sizes
      of the components of a computer's memory hierarchy.</li>
 </ul><pre><code>
		 Access Time		   Size
registers	0.2 - 0.5 ns		256 -  1024 B
L1 cache	0.4 -   1 ns		 32 -   256 KB
L2 cache	  4 -  10 ns		512 KB -  2 MB
main memory	 50 - 500 ns		256 MB - 16 GB
disk		  5 -  15 ms		 80 GB
tape		  1 -  50 s		infinite
 </code></pre>
  <li>As we can see, there are several orders of magnitude difference
      in the access time between registers and main memory.  As a consequence,
      compiler code generators attempt to use registers to hold the most frequently
      used objects in the target program. But since there are a small number
      of registers, the compiler will have to make choices as to what quantities
      it keeps in registers and what quantities it must spill into main memory.</li>
 

 <h2>3. Categories of Target Machines</h2>
 <ul><li>Reduced instruction set machines (RISC)</li>
  <ul><li>many registers</li>
   <li>three-address instructions</li>
   <li>simple addressing modes</li>
   <li>simple instruction set architecture</li>
  </ul><li>Complex instruction set machines (CISC)</li>
  <ul><li>few registers</li>
   <li>two-address instructions</li>
   <li>variety of addressing modes</li>
   <li>several register classes</li>
   <li>variable-length instructions</li>
   <li>instructions with side effects</li>
  </ul><li>Stack-based machines</li>
  <ul><li>push operands onto stack</li>
   <li>perform operations on operands at top of stack</li>
   <li>stack kept in registers</li>
   <li>model for Java Virtual Machine</li>
  </ul><li>Multicore machines</li>
 </ul><h2>4. Primary Tasks of a Code Generator</h2>
  <ul><li>Instruction selection</li>
   <ul><li>Determining factors:</li>
    <ul><li>level of IR</li>
     <li>nature of ISA</li>
     <li>desired quality of generated code</li>
    </ul></ul><li>Register allocation and assignment</li>
   <ul><li>Register allocation determines the set of variables that
        will reside in registers at each point in the program.</li>
    <li>Register assignment determines the specific register in which
        a variable will reside.</li>
   </ul><li>Evaluation order</li>
   <ul><li>Some computation orders require fewer registers to hold intermediate
        results than others.</li>
    <li>Picking an optimal order in the general case is NP-complete.</li>
   </ul></ul><h2>5. Basic Blocks and Flow Graphs</h2>
 <ul><li>A basic block is a maximal sequence of consecutive three-address
     instructions such that</li>
  </ul><ol><li>The flow of control can only enter the basic block throught the
       first instruction in the block.</li>
   <li>Control will leave the block without halting or branching
       except possibly at the last instruction in the block.</li>
  </ol><li>A flow graph for the basic blocks of an intermediate program
      can be constructed as follows:</li>
  <ul><li>The basic blocks are the nodes of the flow graph.</li>
   <li>There is an edge from block B to block C iff it is possible
       for the first instruction in C to immediately follow the last
       instruction in B.</li>
  </ul><li>A set of nodes L in a flow graph is a loop if</li>
  <ol><li>There is a node in L called the loop entry with the property
       that no other node in L has a predecessor outside L.</li>
   <li>Every node in L has a nonempty path completely within L to
       the entry of L.</li>
